* Ring highlighting: mark the rings somehow to keep track of them visually
* IRC connection interface 
	- reconnect/timeouts/etc
	- resume/adjourn/store options
* win check (after move, if win set game_status accordingly)
* save game
* last move + visual informationw when typing move coordinates
* navigate history

	- allow console to display in separate window if non-mobile
	- filter chat messages + add separate console for general logs
    - add touch input
* Restart / game type

* Maybe do as follows: g.brd is untouched. g.brd->child is what is modified by grab_block and locked blocks. Use it to detect rings and etc.
