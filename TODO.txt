* Maybe do as follows: g.brd is untouched. g.brd->child is what is modified by grab_block and locked blocks. Use it to detect rings and etc. 
* Ring highlighting: mark the rings somehow to keep track of them visually
* IRC connection interface 
	- nick chooser
	- status indicator
	- reconnect/timeouts/etc
	- resume/adjourn/store options
* win check (after move, if win set game_status accordingly 
* save game
* settings, interface in general (player name, turn, last move)

implementation for irc:

1) Make fixed size console with fixed size font
	- Resize as needed (if smaller than half-screen, double the size, for instance)
	- display in separate window if non-mobile
	- add one-line text input in the bottom
	- display all logs here (raw irc stuff)

2) Make a chat window smilar to console
